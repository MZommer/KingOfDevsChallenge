## Statement

The objective of the exercise is to write web3 or ethers code that connects to the contract Ballot. This contract allows users to vote different proposals and shows the current available proposals. It is already deployed to Goerli.
What is expected is that you connect to the contract and get all the proposals that exist there.

Notes:

- The abi and address of the contract can be found in the settings.ts file.
- The code needs to be written in the main function of the index.ts file.
- There are already multiple util functions defined and imported that can be used. Each import has a comment stating what that function is for.
- In case needed, more functions can be defined.
- Remember that you would be only reading data from the contract, so no signer wallet would be needed.
